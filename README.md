# Groove Body
[Groove Body](https://amaykataria.com/#/GrooveBody) was developed by Amay Kataria in 2018 as part of the Art & Blockchain residency at Art Center Nabi in Seoul, South Korea. It's a virtual body, visually manifested as a collection of groove coins and functionally with a skills of a dancer. It was created as a virtual identity, that was hypothetically available for fractional ownership via the Blockchain technology. This virtual character possesses the skills to visually pose and perform dance moves to express itself to the owner of a GRVE token. By owning a GRVE token, one gets partial ownership to Groove's virtual identity. 

It's developed using an open-source creative coding library called [Open-Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
