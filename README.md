# Groove-Body
Groove Body was developed as part of the Art & Blockchain residency at Art Center Nabi by Amay Kataria. It's a virtual body, visually manifested as a collection of groove coins and functionally with a skills of a dancer. It was created as a virtual identity, that was hypothetically available for fractional ownership via the Blockchain technology. This virtual character possesses the skills to visually pose and perform dance moves to express itself to the owner of a GRVE token. By owning a GRVE token, one gets partial ownership to (GROOVE) Bodyâ€™s virtual identity.
